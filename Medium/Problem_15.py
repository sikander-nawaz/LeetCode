There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # map each course to prereq list
        preMap = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}

        for crs, pre in prerequisites:
            preMap[crs].append(pre)
        
        # visitSet = all courses along the curr DFS path
        visitSet = set()

        def dfs(crs):
            if crs in visitSet: 
                return False
            if preMap[crs] == []:
                return True
            
            visitSet.add(crs)

            for pre in preMap[crs]:
                if not dfs(pre): return False

            visitSet.remove(crs)
            preMap[crs] = []
            return True
        
        for crs in range(numCourses):
            print(crs)
            if not dfs(crs): return False
        
        return True
